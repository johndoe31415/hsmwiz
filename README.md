# hsmwiz
HSMWiz is a frontend for [OpenSC](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC) to ease
handling of HSMs like the NitroKey HSM USB smart card. It was previously called
"nitrotool" since it only targeted the NitroKey, but has since been renamed
because it actually is not using anything specific to the NitroKey. 

Basically, it is just boilerplate that does nothing more than what is already
described in the [excellent OpenSC tutorial](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/SmartCardHSM)
for the Smart Card HSM. However, there's some annoying issues with that --
multiple tools are needed (pkcs11-tool, pkcs15-tool, sc-hsm-tool, OpenSSL) and
output formats are sometimes not very user friendly (e.g., public keys are
exported as binary DER blobs instead of PEM files). So I wrote this little
frontend to encapsulate common tasks a bit.

## Hardware
The hardware I'm working with is the [NitroKey HSM](https://shop.nitrokey.com),
which is a quite affordable smart-card based USB HSM. I'm in no way affiliated
with them whatsoever, just think they have a pretty cool product.

## CA management and PKI
Once you've a good grip on keys that are working on your HSM, you might want to
use it to create a CA and issue certificates signed by that CA (which has its
key on a hardware token such as the NitroKey HSM). Lucky you, check out the
[x509sak (X.509 Swiss Army Knife)](https://github.com/johndoe31415/x509sak),
the sibling project of hsmwiz, which has that exact capability.

## Usage
All commands have comprehensive help pages. You can get a summary of available
commands by typing:

```
$ hsmwiz

                          keyspec

Create a new private keypair on the smartcard

positional arguments:
  keyspec            Key specification string to generate. Can be either
                     'rsa:BITLENGTH' or 'EC:CURVENAME'. Examples are
                     'rsa:1024', 'EC:brainpool256r1' or 'EC:prime256v1'.

optional arguments:
  --id key_id        Specifies the key ID to use for generating the new key.
                     Must be an integer and defaults to 1.
  --label key_label  Specifies the key label to use for generating the new
                     key.
  --pin pin          Specifies the PIN of the smartcard. If this argument is
                     not given, the command will ask for it interactively.
  --so-path path     Search path, separated by ':' characters, in which to
                     look for shared objects like opensc-pkcs11.so. Defaults
                     to /usr/local/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
  -v, --verbose      Increase verbosity. Can be specified multiple times.
  --help             Show this help page.
```

## Example: General Stuff
You can first query a transponder:

```
$ hsmwiz identify

```

Then, you could use it to generate a new private key:

```
$ hsmwiz genkey EC:prime256v1 --label fookey
Using slot 0 with a present token (0x0)
Logging in to "UserPIN (SmartCard-HSM)".
Please enter User PIN:
Key pair generated:

  EC_POINT:   04410416d236f109229332666236b7af0d46d547cbb125151e1a6a657f2b2b8495b9207d40836ae3f276b55a8989385f46f16006677939b580b66636086dc3f095a4e2

  label:      fookey
  ID:         01

```

Check if that worked by identifying again:

```
$ hsmwiz id

```

Grab the public key:

```
$ hsmwiz getpubkey --label fookey
Using slot 0 with a present token (0x0)
Logging in to "UserPIN (SmartCard-HSM)".
Please enter User PIN:
# ECC key:

```

Or create a CSR from a HSM key:

```
$ hsmwiz gencsr --pin 648219
engine "pkcs11" set.

## Example: Setting up a NitroKey HSM for SSH authentication
Generate a key. For OpenSSH before v8.0, [this has to be an RSA
key](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2474). You can create an
ECDSA/secp256r1 key by using:

```
$ hsmwiz genkey --id 2 --label my-ec-ssh-key --pin 648219 EC:prime256v1
Using slot 0 with a present token (0x0)
Key pair generated:
Private Key Object; EC
  label:      sshkey
  ID:         02
  Usage:      sign, derive
Public Key Object; EC  EC_POINT 256 bits
  EC_POINT:   044104ae19243bc5847e589392ffd6e4a463fd64826db96664b7d61a26c22eb523808bb4e8a31018be80f7aa1353c1f082a1a0c52ae4678129aad91f7908e62ad3081d
  EC_PARAMS:  06082a8648ce3d030107
  label:      sshkey
  ID:         02
  Usage:      verify, derive
```

Alternatively (e.g., if your OpenSSH version doesn't permit ECDSA/PKCS#11),
create an RSA keypair inside the HSM:

```
$ hsmwiz genkey --id 1 --label my-ssh-key --pin 648219 rsa:2048
Using slot 0 with a present token (0x0)
Key pair generated:
Private Key Object; RSA
  label:      my-ssh-key
  ID:         01
  Usage:      decrypt, sign, unwrap
Public Key Object; RSA 2048 bits
  label:      my-ssh-key
  ID:         01
  Usage:      encrypt, verify, wrap
```

After you have created a key, you can easily extract the public key you just
created from the NitroKey in SSH format. For the ECC case, this is done by:

```
$ hsmwiz getkey --id 2 --key-format ssh --pin 648219
Using slot 0 with a present token (0x0)
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBK4ZJDvFhH5Yk5L/1uSkY/1kgm25ZmS31homwi61I4CLtOijEBi+gPeqE1PB8IKhoMUq5GeBKarZH3kI5irTCB0=
```

Or in the case of the RSA example:

```
$ hsmwiz getkey --id 1 --key-format ssh --pin 648219
Using slot 0 with a present token (0x0)
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCV6Fqr80gKq+wV+MA0dMltHTuwMwyVLBvLPdtVYdsw4S2YAjfTDnLATFHOhId/fFDMbSv9qH3YI/F8ryXM8MY53J1bd3Vd5iPbnG8/Azk0F5IUw9u/bhL6/39nFWJqSKww68pe4BFtCHMfPLchT9A6lMk0QOe8rU8VNkgcZsMfQ+iDzd5OmEC7JdlJSY7kCSPHkF/SoJLk5BuftV3kVCm2VAhkMgObbNnw3xHoiL0yv/JZyBly+ssDog72EkNvbYL9bvVMk2ZqYhLESPTwMnh7x1DyznlIC2R3XuqKkrQ5ztMblCAli5S7s1yYSKj4jCYzyIZf2nfPoCTTiqNs7Eyd
```

Add the public key line to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the user/host
you want to authenticate with (i.e., the one with the OpenSSH server).

When you want to login to that server using the HSM, do:

```
$ ssh -o "PKCS11Provider opensc-pkcs11.so" joe@reliant
Enter PIN for 'UserPIN (SmartCard-HSM)':
Welcome to Ubuntu 17.10 (GNU/Linux 4.13.0 x86_64)
Last login: Sat Apr  7 18:40:52 2018 from 127.0.0.1
reliant joe [~]:
```

You'll notice that you were asked to enter your NitroKey PIN. After entry, it
allows SSH access!

## Dependencies
hsmwiz itself only depends on Python3, but assumes you've installed PC/SC,
OpenSC and OpenSSL. It'll use those tools on the command line.
